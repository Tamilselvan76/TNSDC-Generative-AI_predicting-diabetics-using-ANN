Diabetes Prediction using Neural Networks
Overview
This project aims to predict the onset of diabetes in patients using a neural network model trained on a dataset containing various health-related features. The dataset used in this project is the "Pima Indians Diabetes Database", which is publicly available on Kaggle. The neural network model is implemented using the Keras library with TensorFlow backend.

Dependencies
Python 3
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the code interactively)
Libraries:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
keras
Setup
Clone this repository or download the project files.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the project directory.
Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing the code (diabetes_prediction.ipynb or diabetes_prediction.py).
Ensure the dataset file path is correctly specified in the code.
Execute the code cells or run the script to train the neural network model, make predictions, and evaluate its performance.
View the results, including the confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score, to assess the model's performance.
